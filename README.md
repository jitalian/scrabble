<b>Welcome to my Scrabble Game!</b>

<b><u>Game Installation:</b></u><br>
After installing the packages in requirements.txt the game can be played by running main.py.

<b><u>Game Instructions and Information:</b></u><br>
Game Dictionary:<br>
-Due to the official scrabble word list being copyrighted, the Wordnik open-source word 
list found here: https://github.com/wordnik/wordlist is being used in this game.<br>
-Beware that this word list contains many words that would not be in an official scrabble game.<br>

Game Play:<br>
-In order to make the computer moves occur very quickly (in most cases just a fraction of a second) 
the computer is limited to just one blank tile at a time.<br>
-Scoring and other rules follow those found in an official scrabble game.<br>
-At this time there is no way to exchange only some tiles or to scramble your tiles. The reset rack 
button just relocates all of your tiles back to your rack in the same order they started in.

End of Game:<br>
-The game ends as soon as you and the computer both pass 2 times in a row or run out of tiles.<br>
-There is no score adjustment for either player based on the remaining tiles in the other's rack.
